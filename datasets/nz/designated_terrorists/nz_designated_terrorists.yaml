  Individuals and entities that have been designated terrorists by the New Zeland government
description: |
  This dataset comprises individuals and entities that have been 
  designated terrorist by the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 (TSA).
  The data comprises two different lists:
  entities associated with Resolutions 1267/1989/2253/1988 and
  entities associated with Resolution 1373. The former is the same
  as the UNSC sanction list, so this dataset focus only on resolution 1373.
