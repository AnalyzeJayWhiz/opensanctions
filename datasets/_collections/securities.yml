  Custom export of sanctioned public companies and their securities identifiers.
description: |
  This collection produces a custom export of all sanctioned organizations,
  with a column to designate their LEI codes, where available. We also include
  a column that lists all known ISINs per company.

  Finally, the table also lists all Russian companies that have been assigned
  an ISIN, and thus are subject to investment bans under US EO 14071.
