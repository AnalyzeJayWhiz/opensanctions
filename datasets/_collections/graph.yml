description: |
  This dataset contains companies and persons not linked to any risk indication. It can
  be used to perform screening and know-your-business checks in the listed jurisdictions.

  The data is updated less frequently than the main OpenSanctions dataset, and is not
  internally resolved in the same way. It is intended to be used as a reference dataset
  for data analytics and research purposes.

  This data is the source for [OpenScreening](https://resources.linkurious.com/openscreening).
