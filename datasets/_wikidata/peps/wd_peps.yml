  Profiles of politically exposed persons from Wikidata, the structured data version of 
  Wikipedia.
description: |
  This dataset includes the profiles of politically exposed persons from Wikidata into
  OpenSanctions. It does so by monitoring the Wikidata items describing a broad range
  of political positions (e.g.: [member of the German Bundestag](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1939555),
  or [German Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q568605))
  and tracking the individuals who hold this post at different times.

  The set of posts and positions that are tracked are curated by the OpenSanctions team
  and will include:

  * National legislatures
  * National cabinets and ministerial positions
  * Some senior administrative positions
  * Diplomatic and military leadership
  * Supreme court judges
  * Central bank governors

  Going forward, we will also include sub-national positions, include state legislatures 
  in federally organized countries, as well as state-level senior executives.

  Politically exposed persons are included after they retire from public office for a
  period determined by [a number of rules](https://www.opensanctions.org/docs/pep/methodology)
  to handle missing data and different levels of influence of positions.
