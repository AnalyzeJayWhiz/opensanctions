  The antiboycott provisions of the EAR encourage, and in specified cases, require U.S. 
  persons to refuse to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts. They have the effect 
  of preventing U.S. persons from advancing foreign policies of other nations that run 
  counter to U.S. policy.

  This list is provided to assist U.S. persons to fulfill the reporting requirements of the 
  antiboycott regulations by raising awareness regarding certain sources of boycott-related 
  requests. Each entity on this list has been reported by a U.S. person to BIS on a boycott 
  request report form, as required by section 760.5 of the EAR, as having made a boycott-related 
  request in connection with a transaction in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United 
  States. The list is not exhaustive and will be updated quarterly.

    BIS is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, where it manages the intersection 
    between business and the foreign policy and security interests of the U.S.
    The Office of Antiboycott Compliance (OAC) within BIS is charged with administering 
    and enforcing the Anti-Boycott Act of 2018, Part II of the Export Control Reform Act 
    of 2018 (ECRA), and the antiboycott provisions set forth in part 760 of the Export 
    Administration Regulations, 15 CFR parts 730-774 (EAR). These authorities discourage, 
    and in some circumstances, prohibit U.S. companies from taking certain actions in 
    furtherance or support of a boycott maintained by a foreign country against a country 
    friendly to the United States (unsanctioned foreign boycott).
