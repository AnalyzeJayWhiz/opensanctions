description: |
  > Pursuant to Section 1128 and Section 1902(a)(39) of the Social Security Act, the Medicaid Program will not
  > reimburse a provider for any services or items that were rendered or ordered/prescribed by a sanctioned
  > (e.g., suspended, excluded) provider.  The effect of the provider's sanction precludes them from furnishing,
  > ordering, or prescribing services or items to any Medicaid beneficiary. Claims for services/items
  > rendered/ordered/prescribed by a sanctioned provider with dates of service or dispensing after the effective
  > date of the sanction, will be rejected or disallowed if discovered during a post-payment review. Refills of
  > prescriptions written by a sanctioned provider must not be dispensed beyond the effective date of the sanction
  > letter. Claims for services/items rendered/ordered/prescribed by a provider for whom sanctions have been removed
  > will be honored retroactively to the date the sanction ended.
