description: |
  Pursuant to Section 1128 and Section 1902(a)(39) of the Social Security Act, the Medicaid Program will not
  reimburse a provider for any services or items that were rendered or ordered/prescribed by a sanctioned
  (e.g., suspended, excluded) provider.  The effect of the provider's sanction precludes them from furnishing,
  ordering, or prescribing services or items to any Medicaid beneficiary.
