  Current and recent members of the United States Senate and House of Representatives
description: >
  The US Congress is the collection of members of both houses of its
  legislature - the Senate and the House of Representatives. 

  Members of the House of Representatives are elected to serve a two-year
  term representing the people of each person's district. Each state,
  regardless of its size, has at least one representative.

  Each member of the Senate is elected to serve a six-year term representing
  the people of that person's state. Each state, regardless of its size, has
  two senators. Senatorial terms are staggered, so every two years
  approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election. Each staggered
  group of one-third of the senators is called a 'class'. No state has both
  its senators in the same class. [Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Congress)
