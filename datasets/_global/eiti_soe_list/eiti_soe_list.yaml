  acronym: EITI
  description: |
    As the energy transition gains traction, it will have a transformative impact on the extractive 
    industries and global economy. The EITI Standard can play a role in building awareness of how the 
    transition will affect extractive sector activities and revenues and in supporting the responsible 
    and transparent production of minerals that are critical for a sustainable future. The EITI provides 
    data that can help identify and close channels for corruption – not only in mining, oil and gas but 
    increasingly in the renewables sector.    
    
    In each country that has joined the EITI, a multi-stakeholder group, composed of government, companies 
    and civil society, supports implementation of the EITI Standard.
