  The Global Energy Ownership Tracker provides information on the chain of ownership for 
  various energy projects. The data maps each level of the chain from the direct owner 
  (as in, the lowest-level identified owner in the chain of ownership) up to their 
  highest-level ultimate parents (e.g., corporations, investment firms, and governments). 
  Ownership links are reported with the percentage of ownership, including owners that have 
  controlling interest as well as those with minority, non-controlling interests (if over a 
  threshold of 5% ownership).
