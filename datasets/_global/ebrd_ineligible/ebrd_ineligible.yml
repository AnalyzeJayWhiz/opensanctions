  Entities that have been declared ineligible to become EBRD counterparties due to fraud, 
  corruption, collusion, or other prohibited practices.
description: |
  This dataset lists entities and individuals that are ineligible to participate in 
  EBRD-financed projects. It includes detailed information such as the firm names, 
  addresses, periods of ineligibility, and the specific prohibited practices they were 
  involved in (e.g., fraud, corruption, collusion). The EBRD presents several separate 
  tables of ineligble entities, including one with cross-debarred entities, those originated 
  within EBRD, and sanctions resulting from third-party finding. It's unclear if these 
  overlap.

  description: |
    Founded in 1991, the EBRD provides project financing mainly for private enterprises, 
    usually together with other commercial lending partners, in countries that are committed 
    to, and apply, democratic principles. It also works with public partners to support 
    privatisation, restructuring and improvement of municipal services. It does this by 
    financing investments, providing business services and getting involved in high-level 
    policy dialogue in these countries to support private sector development.
