description: |
  This is a dataset of politically exposed persons in Africa collected by Chipper
  to support their risk management practices. To start with, it consists of a vast
  number of PEPs in Nigeria, with plans to expand to other countries in the future.

  It is not considered to be comprehensive, but significantly augments PEP
  identification data already available on the market.

  Nigeria follows the "Once a PEP, always a PEP" duration practice, meaning people
  may remain in this dataset longer than for data sourced for other jurisdictions.
