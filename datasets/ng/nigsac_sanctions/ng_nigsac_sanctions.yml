  > of the Federation issued a Regulation for the Implementation of Targeted
  > Financial Sanctions Related to Terrorism, Terrorism Financing and Other Related
  > Matters, 2022. The law gave Nigeria a legal framework for the implementation of
  > United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) related to counter-financing
  > of terrorism and counter-proliferation financing as well as in line with the
  > Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations. The TPPA incorporated the
  > Nigeria Sanctions Committee (NSC) which was earlier established by the Terrorism
  > Prevention (Freezing of International Terrorist Funds and Other Related Measures)
  > Regulations, 2013 (TPR). The TPPA also expanded the functions of the NSC by
  > identifying it as the body responsible for the implementation of UNSCRs related
  > to proliferation financing.
