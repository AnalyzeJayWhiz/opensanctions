  The United Kingdom's list of Proscribed Organizations under the
  Terrorism Act 2000
description: |
  Under the Terrorism Act 2000, the UK Home Secretary may proscribe an
  organisation under certain criteria.  The complete list of
  proscribed organizations is published in Schedule 2 of the Act.

  It is a criminal offense to belong or profess to belong to a
  proscribed organization, or to support (materially or morally) such
  an organization.

  These restrictions also apply to other groups proscribed under
  previous legislation regarding the conflict in Northern Ireland.

  You can find more information about proscription [in the Home
  Office's Policy Paper
