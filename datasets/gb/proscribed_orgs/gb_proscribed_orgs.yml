  The United Kingdom's list of Proscribed Organizations under the
  Terrorism Act 2000
description: |
  Under the Terrorism Act 2000, the UK Home Secretary may proscribe an
  organisation under certain criteria.

  It is a criminal offense to belong or profess to belong to a
  proscribed organization, or to support (materially or morally) such
  an organization.

  These restrictions apply equally to other groups proscribed under
  previous legislation regarding the conflict in Northern Ireland.

  The complete list of proscribed organizations is published in
  Schedule 2 of the Act.
