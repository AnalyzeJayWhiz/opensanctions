   The Iran Business Registry (IBR) tracks companies and entities engaged in business with 
   or within Iran. The database relies on credible media, academic sources, and reports to 
   document international trade and business operations involving Iran. The registry spans 
   multiple sectors, including energy, logistics, healthcare, and more. Each entity is 
   documented with information such as nationality, stock symbol, and whether the company 
   has ceased business operations in Iran. 
   
   IBR plays a crucial role in promoting transparency and compliance with sanctions and 
   humanitarian exemptions, helping companies navigate the complexities of Iranian trade 
   regulations.
