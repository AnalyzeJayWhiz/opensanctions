  The FCA List is updated based on information received by BNM from members
  of the public, after conducting necessary assessments on the reported
  entities and schemes. Consumers may refer to the FCA List as one
  of several ways to check if an entity or a scheme has been
  identified as one that has not been authorised by BNM
  to offer financial products or services that are regulated by BNM.
