  The annotations dataset consists of detail added by the OpenSanctions team
  to enrich the data from our other sources with detail from our knowledge and
  desktop research. This includes, for example, that a position like
  "Advisor to the president of Russia" is a PEP, and a national government PEP
  at that, while "President of the water polo club" is not a PEP.
