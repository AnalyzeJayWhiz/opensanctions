  Wanted terrorists list of Turkey Ministry of Interior
description: |
  Turkey has published a list of its most wanted terrorists, which includes details such as names, birth years, and places of birth. 
  
  These individuals are classified into five color-coded categories, ranging from red (kırmızı) — indicating the most wanted — to blue (mavi), green (yeşil), orange (turuncu), and grey (gri). 
  
  Each category corresponds to a different reward amount for information that leads to the capture of these wanted individuals.

  **Note**: There are concerns about the list lacking a proper legal foundation due to the absence of a legal provision that regulates who can be included, 
  how individuals can be removed, 
  and how authorities can establish or manage the list.
