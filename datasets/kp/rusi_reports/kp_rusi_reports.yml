  The DPRK Reports database contains structured information relating to the
  activities of entities that assist North Korea to develop prohibited
  weapons programmes and evade sanctions. The data is sourced from the
  United Nations Panel of Experts reports, from 2010 to 2023, as well as
  the associated UN sanctions resolutions.

  It includes profiles of the persons, companies, organizations, and vessels
  that are mentioned in the reports, and contains information such as
  names, aliases, locations, contact details and sanction designation
  status. The database also records the relationships between entities
  and their involvement or relationship to specific events.

  The objective of this database is to provide national authorities and
  private-sector institutions with information that can assist with
  sanctions implementation efforts such as due diligence and compliance.
