  Members of the House of Parliament of the Cayman Islands in the 2021-2025 legislative term.

  In October 2023 the http://www.legislativeassembly.ky/ website was taken down
  while being rebuilt, referring to an 
  [archive copy](https://archives.gov.ky/sites/legislativeassembly/portal/page/portal/lglhome/members/elected-2021-2025.html)
  and the [Cayman Islands Government website](https://www.gov.ky/) for updates.

  The latter only includes the executive branch, and is not well-suited for automatic
  updates so this dataset publishes a static copy of the data from http://www.legislativeassembly.ky/
  with a small number of updates from the Cabinet page of www.gov.ky until
  the replacement Legislative Assembly site is available.
