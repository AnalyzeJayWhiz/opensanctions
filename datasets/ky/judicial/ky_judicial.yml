      "The Judiciary is one of three separate arms of Government. Its function
      is to administer the law independently of the Executive and the Legislative
      arms of Government; an independence that is safeguarded in the Constitution of
      the Cayman Islands. The Judiciary is comprised of the following jurisdictions
      in ascending order within the hierarchy of the courts: The Summary Court, The
      Grand Court, Court of Appeal, Privy Council"
