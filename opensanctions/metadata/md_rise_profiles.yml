summary: >
  People of Interest is an interactive database developed and managed by RISE Moldova.
  It is a work in progress journalistic project.
description: |
  On this platform, we outline the profiles of public figures and their connections. 
  We index data about their companies, cases, properties, narrow interests, and 
  intermediaries.
  We verify the information we publish here from several open and closed sources.
  We have met the persons from the People of Interest Platform several times in our 
  journalistic documentations. Whether they vote laws, juggle with public money, 
  or they are intermediaries or wealthy businessmen, their decisions affect us all.
