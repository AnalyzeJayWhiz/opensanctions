summary: |
  A concatenated data file of all entities which have been issued Legal
  Entity Identifier (LEI) codes.
description: |
  Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) are global company identification numbers. It is
  meant to be used in international transactions in the future, backed by an
  ISO-developed standard.

  The GLEIF group assembles a database of all entities which have been issued an
  LEI and is published as open data on the web.
