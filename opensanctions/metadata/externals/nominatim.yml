title: OpenStreetMap Nominatim
summary: |
  Nominatim is a geocoding system based on OpenStreetMap, the open map of the
  world created by a community of mappers.
description: |
  We're using Nominatim to disambiguate the addresses linked to sanctions targets
  in OpenSanctions in order to create fewer and cleaner entries for addresses.

  Currently, the imported data does not include latitude/longitude coordinates in
  order to not produce a false sense of precision. Lat/lons can be provided upon
  demand.
