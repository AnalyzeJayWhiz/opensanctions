summary: |
  Wikidata is the structured data project of the Wikipedia community,
  providing fact-based information edited by humans and machines.
description: |
  Wikidata serves as the source of much of the OpenSanctions data related to
  politically exposed persons (PEPs). We also link up entities that are 
  sanctioned whenever a relevant Wikidata item is available.

  There is no attempt to link companies and organizations from sanctions lists
  to Wikidata, as the way that an encyclopedia describes such legal entities is
  not granular enough for due diligence use cases.
